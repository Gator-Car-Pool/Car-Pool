## Overview
### Description
Allows University of Florida students to carpool with each other. After chatting, riders can request rides from drivers, and drivers can accept them.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Travel
- **Mobile:** This app will be developed for mobile (iOS first, maybe Android later)
- **Story:** After signing up, the user can see nearby users. If they designate themself as a driver, they will be shown riders and can accept ride requests. If they designate themself as a rider, they will be shown drivers and can request rides. After acceptance, the route to the rider will automatically be opened up in the driver's map app.
- **Market:** University of Florida students
- **Habit:** This app can be used as often or unoften as the user wants.
- **Scope:** We will implement the most essential features to make our app functional for University of Florida students.
